# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

# Problem Statement
The problem is to develop a Streamlit application that allows users to upload a business card image and extract key information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information includes company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The application should provide a user-friendly GUI to guide users through the process and display the extracted information in an organized manner. Additionally, users should be able to save the extracted information and the uploaded image into a database capable of storing multiple entries. The application should support data management operations such as reading, updating, and deleting entries through the Streamlit UI. The development will require expertise in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management. Proper application architecture design, scalability, maintainability, and extensibility are crucial, along with comprehensive documentation and code organization.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a Streamlit application that empowers users to effortlessly upload business card images, extract vital information using easyOCR, and showcase the extracted details in a visually appealing and organized manner within the application's graphical user interface (GUI). The application should enable users to save the extracted information, along with the corresponding business card image, into a database capable of storing multiple entries. Users should have the ability to read, update, and delete data through the Streamlit UI, providing comprehensive data management capabilities.

To achieve these objectives, the project will leverage Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system such as SQLite or MySQL. The application should prioritize a user-friendly interface, guiding users through the process of uploading business card images and extracting their information. The architecture of the application should be thoughtfully designed, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. Additionally, the project emphasizes the importance of meticulous documentation and code organization to facilitate understanding and future development efforts.

   - Plan the overall structure and flow of the application.

2. Set up the Development Environment:
   - Install the required dependencies, including Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and the chosen database management system.
   - Set up the project directory and organize the files and folders.
   - Configure the database connection and create the necessary tables for storing the extracted information.

3. Develop the User Interface:
   - Create a Streamlit application with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - Design the GUI to guide users through the process of uploading a business card image.
   - Implement the functionality to display the extracted information in a clean and organized manner.
   - Provide buttons or controls for users to add the extracted information to the database.

4. Implement Image Processing and OCR Extraction:
   - Integrate easyOCR into the application to process the uploaded business card image.
   - Extract the relevant information, including the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code.
   - Validate and format the extracted information as required.

5. Connect to the Database and Store Data:
   - Set up the connection to the chosen database management system (SQLite or MySQL).
   - Define the necessary functions to store the extracted information along with the uploaded business card image.
   - Implement the functionality to save the data into the database for each entry.
   - Ensure the application handles multiple entries correctly.

6. Enable Data Management Operations:
   - Implement features to allow users to read, update, and delete data through the Streamlit UI.
   - Provide options to search and filter data based on different criteria.
   - Implement the necessary functions to handle data updates and deletions from the database.

7. Test and Debug:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure all components of the application work as expected.
   - Validate the OCR extraction accuracy by uploading various business card images.
   - Identify and fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
   
8. Document and Organize Code:
   - Write clear and comprehensive documentation that explains the application's functionality, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
   - Organize the codebase with proper modularization and adhere to best practices for code readability and maintainability.
   - Document any external dependencies or specific configuration requirements.

9. Deployment and Maintenance:
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform or server for public or internal use.
   - Monitor the application for performance, scalability, and potential security vulnerabilities.
   - Regularly update and maintain the application, including security patches, feature enhancements, and bug fixes.
   - Continuously improve the application based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

By following this workflow, you can successfully develop a Streamlit application that enables users to upload business card images, extract relevant information using easyOCR, display it in a GUI, and save it into a database for efficient data management.
